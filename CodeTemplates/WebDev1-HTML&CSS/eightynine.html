        In 1989, regional independent labels dominated with superstar singings: Young MC and the  Pharcyde are signed to Delicious Vinyl. Biz Markie (Just a Friend), Big Daddy Kane (Smooth Operator), and Marley Marl are all on Cold Chillin'. Ruthless, Eazy E's label, has N.W.A. and the D.O.C. on its roster. Jive is crushing it with a roster that includes Boogie Down Productions, DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, and Too $hort. And Tommy Boy presciently released both De La Soul and Queen Latifah's first albums.
