            In hip hop so much can be explained by the rise and fall of record labels.

            Lil Wayne's ascent is the story of <b>Cash Money</b>. The dirty South starts with <b>LaFace Records</b>. The east-coast/west-coast feud is <b>Bad Boy</b> vs. <b>Death Row</b>. In hip hop, the artist-label relationship isnt just a business deal, but a commitment to an identity

            We wanted to surface the notable labels in hip hop'' history, so we measured every label by its artists' chart performance on Billboard(collaborating with <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinbeacham">Kevin Beacham</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhymesayers_Entertainment">Rhymesayers</a> to call out insights). By highlighting the labels who produced the most hits at any given time, we'd understand who was wielding enormous influence on hip hops's sound, distribution, and direction.
